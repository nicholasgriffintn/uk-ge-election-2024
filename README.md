# UK GE Election 2024

This repo contains a bit of a playground for me to make some tools using the 2024 UK General Election data.

It's not intended to be used for anything serious, but if you want to use it for something, feel free.

## Data

The data is from the [House of Commons Library](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10009/).

## Tasks

- [x] API App with bronze data
- [ ] A pipeline to create silver data
- [ ] A pipeline to create gold data
- [ ] API app updated to query gold data
- [ ] A front end to display the data
- [ ] A CloudFlare AI worker that can query the data
